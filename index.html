Buddy had no one to look after him and he lay in the courtyard of the house, timid, forlorn and tied to a chain. “It took us a couple of hours to cajole Buddy and earn his trust. He was traumatised, scared and we didn’t know if he had had food since the death of his parent,” founder of the organisation that rescued Buddy</h3>

Recently, we got a request from a woman whose husband and mother-in-law died due to COVID. She had to travel to her hometown and couldn’t take care of their three cats. Since we don’t have a shelter home, we are working closely with feeders who go around feeding these felines. Although we have managed to get a few cats adopted through social media, there are roughly 60-100 cats still looking for a family.”</h3>
